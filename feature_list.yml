# Feature List

## v1 – Foundation
- Recursively scan a working directory.
- Infer an Artist → Album → Track hierarchy from folder structure.
- CLI command `list` to display a tree view.
- CLI command `read-metadata <path>` to output metadata for a specific file.
- CLI command `write-metadata <path> [options]` to update fields (artist, album, title, track number, etc.).
- Public APIs and data models are fully covered by unit tests.

## v2 – AI‑Agent Integration (future scope)
- MCP‑aware command syntax and structured JSON output.
- Support for additional formats: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.dsf`.
- Generate a `.cue` file for an album folder using track metadata.
- Incremental processing for new folders.

## Non‑Goals
- No internet metadata lookup.
- No playback or GUI.
- No external services or database.
- No code that infers artist/album beyond folder names.

## Design Principles
- Small, composable modules.
- Clear data models (Artist, Album, Track, Metadata).
- Format‑agnostic interfaces (traits) for audio files.
- Deterministic behavior: same input yields same output.
- AI‑friendly output: machine‑readable JSON by default.
- Incremental processing: new folders can be scanned without full rebuild.
