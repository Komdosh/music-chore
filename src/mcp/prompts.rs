        r#"I want you to analyze my music library at "{path}" and predict my top 10 favorite tracks.

Here's how to approach this:

1. First, use the `scan_directory` tool with `json_output: true` to get all tracks.
2. Then use `get_library_tree` to understand the library hierarchy.
3. Analyze the results looking for these signals of a "loved" track:
   - **Artist frequency**: Artists with many albums/tracks likely indicate strong preference.
   - **Metadata completeness**: Well-tagged tracks suggest the owner cares about them.
   - **Genre patterns**: Identify the dominant genres — tracks in these genres are more likely favorites.
   - **Album completeness**: Complete albums (vs. scattered singles) suggest intentional collection.

Present your findings as:
- A ranked list of 10 tracks with reasoning for each pick.
- A brief "taste profile" summary explaining my overall music personality.
- 3 honorable mentions that almost made the list."#
